Twenty-five years ago the adaptive decoupling hypothesis proposed that selection at one life stage was decoupled from another life stage by the process of metamorphosis. However, all life stages develop from a single genome, and pleiotropic tradeoffs among life stages are expected to be common. Comparative genomics now offers an opportunity to test these contrasting predictions  for fitness tradeoffs (or lack thereof) among life stages. Single- generation experiments can clarify genomic responses to artificial selection and complement other evolutionary approaches.


| Hypothesis | Prediction | Data supporting prediction | 
-----------------------------------------
| adaptive decoupling hypothesis | Genes experiencing strong selection at one life stage are neutral at another life stage | Genes change significantly in frequency in response to selection at one life stage where they are likely expressed, but do not change significantly in frequency at a different life stage where they may or may not be expressed |
| Synergistic pleiotropy | Genes experiencing strong selection at one life stage also experience strong selection in the same direction in a subsequent life stage | Genes that change significantly in frequency in response to selection at one life stage, change frequency significantly in the same direction in a subsequent life stage, and are likely expressed at both life stages |
| Antagonistic pleiotropy | Genes experiencing strong selection at one life stage, experience strong selection in the opposite direction in a subsequent life stage | Genes that change significantly in frequency in response to selection at one life stage, change frequency significantly in the opposite direction in a subsequent life stage, and are likely expressed at both life stages |
